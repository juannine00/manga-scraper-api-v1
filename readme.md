# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This project is designed to scrape data from the website [KomikCast](https://komikcast.cz/). It extracts details about anime series and their episodes. The scraped data includes series details such as titles, ratings, and descriptions, as well as a list of chapters with their links and dates.

(public api not available , so host it by yourself :D )
